# double_exposure_CP
Our Project can be basically devided in to 2 part, generating double exposure images and evaluate double exposure image.
## Double Exposure Image Generation
For the Generation part, we use 3 different method:
- Traditional Operation (Traditional Operation/Pipeline(Tradition).ipynb)
- ControlNet (ControlNet/ControlNet_Pipeline_HedTest.ipynb)
- Stable Diffusion (latent_blending/SD_blending_latents.ipynb)
